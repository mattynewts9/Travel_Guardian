  <h2 class="mt-4">Travel Tips</h2>
  <p>Here are some useful tips for your visit to the UK:</p>
  <ul class="text-center custom-square-bullets">
    <li>Always carry an umbrella; the weather can be unpredictable!</li>
    <li>Make sure to have an international calling plan for your phone.</li>
    <li>Public transport is a great way to get around; consider getting an Oyster card if you're in London.</li>
    <li>Learn a few basic British phrases and slang to enhance your experience.</li>
    <li>As well as writing down your contacts on paper for safekeeping, it’s a good idea to highlight who your emergency contacts are in your phone by using the prefix "ICE" ("in case of emergency").</li>
    <li>If you’re in a new destination and don’t know where to start, apps such as Meetup help you find people with similar interests. Give your new friends a call and head out to explore the local area together.</li>
    <li>Carry British Pounds (£) for small purchases and consider contactless payments.</li>
    <li>Tipping is appreciated in restaurants (around 10-15%) but not mandatory.</li>
    <li>Respect personal space and remember that saying “sorry” is common in conversations.</li>
    <li>If driving, remember to drive on the left and watch out for cyclists.</li>
    <li>Public toilets may charge a fee; look for signs in public areas.</li>
    <li>Dressing in layers is key, as the UK weather can change quickly.</li>
    <li>Consider a local SIM card for better communication and avoiding roaming fees.</li>
    <li>Use public transport apps like Citymapper or Trainline for navigation.</li>
    <li>Many museums offer free entry, so check for special exhibitions.</li>
    <li>Queuing is important; always wait your turn in line.</li>
